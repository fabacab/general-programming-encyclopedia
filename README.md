# General Programming Encyclopedia

This collection of files is an attempt to make the very simple ideas on which all computer programming is based, well, simple to understand, inspired by my [similarly motivated `data-structures-and-algorithms`](https://github.com/meitar/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/master/README.markdown#motivation). Too often, programming books are written for other programmers. This is a problem if one is trying to "learn to code" but does not *already* "know how to code."
